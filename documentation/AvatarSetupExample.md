## Simple Setup with one contact receiver
1. Create a new Unity object. In this example "Head" <br> <img src="./pictures/UnityObject.png" width="400" >
2. Add a VRC Contact Receiver (Script) to the object. <br> <img src="./pictures/VrcContactReciver.png" width="400" >
3. Setup your values as you see fit. <span style="color:red">!Important!</span> : Make sure that the "Receiver Type" is set to "Proximity" <br> <img src="./pictures/ContactOnAvatar1.png" width="400">
4. Setup the "Config.ini" file. This is an example for this application: <br>
    ``` ini #38,42
    [Defaults]

    # Source IP & port is the VRC OSC server to listen to:

    sourceIP = 127.0.0.1
    sourcePort = 9001

    # Target IP & port is the OSC server to send to:

    targetIP = ${sourceIP}
    targetPort = 9002

    # Calculated velocity will be linearly interpolated between 0 and 1 based on    these values:
    # Velocity < minVelocity, Velocity = 0
    # Velocity > maxVelocity, Velocity = 1

    minVelocity = 0.1
    maxVelocity = 0.5

    [VelocityProximityDetectors]

    # Comma separated parameter keys for each proximity value (reported from a  spherical contact receiver) that is being used to approximate velocity:

    parameterKeys = pat_head

    # The radius of each proximity contact receiver, comma separated. The number of     radii should match the number of parameter keys:

    radii = 0.08

    [HapticDevice1]

    # Target server can be set individually for each haptic device, otherwise it's  set to the default:

    targetIP = ${Defaults:targetIP}
    targetPort = ${Defaults:targetPort}

    # Each haptic device can also have its own min and max velocity set:

    minVelocity = ${Defaults:minVelocity} 
    maxVelocity = ${Defaults:maxVelocity}

    # Comma separated list of parameter keys corresponding to velocity proximity    detectors to be used to estimate contact sender velocity for this device:

    velocityProximityKeys = ${VelocityProximityDetectors:parameterKeys}

    # Proximity parameter key for how close the contact sender is to the device     (between 0 and 1)
    # Output "velocity" will be multiplied by this value:

    proximityKey = proximity_01

    # Additional Haptic device template:
    # (You can add as many as you like, as long as the headers are unique and are   prefixed with "HapticDevice"):

    ```
